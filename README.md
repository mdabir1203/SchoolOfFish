![sof](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/637d2cc3-f1ed-4f1a-889d-e419f068dd28)

A mesmerizing and interactive 3D-like School of Fish visualization built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. This project showcases the collective behavior of fish, simulating realistic movement and interaction with the mouse.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an engaging visual experience of a school of fish swimming in an ocean-like environment. The fish react to mouse movements, switching between attraction and repulsion modes, enhancing the interactive aspect of the visualization.

## How GPT-4 and Claude.AI Contributed

The development of this project was significantly enhanced by leveraging the capabilities of GPT-4 and Claude.AI. Over seven iterations, these AI models provided valuable insights, code suggestions, and improvements, ensuring a smooth development process. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each iteration and how the AI models contributed:

### Iteration 1: Initial Concept and Setup
- **GPT-4** helped define the initial project structure and set up the HTML5 canvas.
- **Claude.AI** provided suggestions on the basic layout and styling to create a visually appealing background.
