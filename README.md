# SchoolOfFish

A mesmerizing and interactive 3D-like School of Fish visualization built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. This project showcases the collective behavior of fish, simulating realistic movement and interaction with the mouse.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an engaging visual experience of a school of fish swimming in an ocean-like environment. The fish react to mouse movements, switching between attraction and repulsion modes, enhancing the interactive aspect of the visualization.

## How GPT-4 and Claude.AI Contributed

The development of this project was significantly enhanced by leveraging the capabilities of GPT-4 and Claude.AI. Over seven iterations, these AI models provided valuable insights, code suggestions, and improvements, ensuring a smooth development process. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each iteration and how the AI models contributed:

### Iteration 1: Initial Concept and Setup
- **GPT-4** helped define the initial project structure and set up the HTML5 canvas.
- **Claude.AI** provided suggestions on the basic layout and styling to create a visually appealing background.

### Iteration 2: Basic Fish Movement
- **GPT-4** assisted in implementing the core logic for fish movement, including random initialization and basic update functions.
- **Claude.AI** contributed by optimizing the movement algorithm for smoother transitions.

### Iteration 3: 3D-like Effects
- **GPT-4** suggested techniques to simulate a 3D effect using size and z-index variations.
- **Claude.AI** refined these suggestions, ensuring the fish appeared more dynamic and lifelike.

### Iteration 4: Mouse Interaction
- **GPT-4** provided the initial code for mouse interaction, allowing fish to be attracted or repelled by the mouse pointer.
- **Claude.AI** enhanced this functionality by fine-tuning the interaction radius and responsiveness.

### Iteration 5: Visual Enhancements
- **GPT-4** recommended adding water and ripple effects to enhance the visual experience.
- **Claude.AI** helped implement these effects, ensuring they blended seamlessly with the fish movement.

### Iteration 6: Performance Optimization
- **GPT-4** identified performance bottlenecks and suggested optimization techniques.
- **Claude.AI** provided additional tips on using offscreen canvases to reduce rendering overhead.

### Iteration 7: Final Touches and Bug Fixes
- **GPT-4** assisted in the final review, identifying and fixing any remaining bugs.
- **Claude.AI** contributed to polishing the code, ensuring readability and maintainability.
